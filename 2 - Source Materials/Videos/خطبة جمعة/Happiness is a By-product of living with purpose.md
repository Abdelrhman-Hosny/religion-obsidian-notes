## Happiness is a By-product of living with purpose

Someone asked NAK what duas they needed to have an easy life.

NAK highlights why people are psychological attracted to video games.
- video games often have certain rules, it is of deterministic nature, if you do this, you kill the boss.
- two people putting in the same work usually get the same results 

People sometimes want to apply that to their life which just isn't the case

- we've all studied at uni for an exam we barely passed and some other kid gets an A with minimal effort which is "not fair"

But life in general has no formula.

People want that formula so bad because they have a certain goal of wanting to be happy. It's okay to have that as a goal but not as the ultimate goal.

The Quran argues that being happy is better achieved when you live with purpose.

"كل نفس ذائقة الموت و نبلوكم بالشر و الخير فتنة و إلينا ترجعون"

Allah states that YOU'LL face evil that you cannot run away from.

You'll be tested with evil and you have to be prepared for it.

معنى بلاء

عندما كان يموت الرجل، كانت تربط ناقته عند قبره فلا تأكل و لا تشرب حتى تموت موتا بطيئا. و يقال الناقة فى بلاء.

So the tests won't be quick and just be done with it, it will be continuous.

And Allah testing you with good might be bad for you if you fail the test.

And testing you with evil might be the best thing that happened to you because you passed the test.
