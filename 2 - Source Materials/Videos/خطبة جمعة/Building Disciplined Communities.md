## Building Disciplined Communities

NAK discusses surah Al Saff, it most probably was revealed after Uhudd

In Uhudd,  the prophet was injured severely, 70 important companions were killed and later mutilated.

"سبح لله ما فى السماوات و ما فى الأرض و هو العزيز الحكيم"

Allah starts with mentioning that everything in the heavens and the earth does tasbeeh, which reminds you that even if you falter, even if you have your ups and downs in your worship, everything else is doing their best.

"و له من فى السماوات و الأرض لا يستكبرون عن عبادته و لا يستحسرون * يسبحون الليل و النهار لا يفترون"

And this ties to the first time tasbeeh was mentioned in the quran by the angels when Allah told him he was creating Adam

وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً قَالُوا أَتَجْعَلُ فِيهَا مَن يُفْسِدُ فِيهَا وَيَسْفِكُ الدِّمَاءَ وَنَحْنُ نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ وَنُقَدِّسُ لَكَ قَالَ إِنِّي أَعْلَمُ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ

Tasbeeh is used in many places instead of prayer and the ultimate form of tasbeeh is prayer

People often fail to recognize the name العزيز الحكيم

Some people refuse to recognize the authority, others question the wisdom behind the authority and ask why did allah order such and such and I don't see the point.

One of the narrations surrounding the revelation of this surah was that
- A new sahabi came and asked the prophet what is the best thing to do and allah reveled fighting and people didn't like that

The first ayah answers this by saying that all creation is worshipping and you not doing so won't affect العزيز الحكيم

"يا أيها الذين ءامنوا لم تقولون ما لا تفعلون"

This is open ended question and can be applied to different cases not just سبب النزول

Population of madinah could be split into 3 parts
- السابقون الأولون من المهاجرين و الأنصار
    - العشرة المبشرون، سادة الأنصار ....
- المنافقون
    - عبدالله بن أبى و من معه
    - من ه‍ؤلاء الناس من أسلم ليصلى و يصوم و لكن شق عليه الجهاد و استضافة المهاجرين
- المسلمون الجدد
    - هم الذين لم يستقر إيمانهم بعد فأحيانا يتأثرون بالسابقين و أحيانا بالمنافقين

When Allah says in madani Quran 
"يا أيها الذين ءامنوا" 
Allah is talking to all 3 factions but mostly targeting the middle faction telling them to be like السابقون and not the منافقون.

"يا أيها الذين آمنوا آمنوا"

المقصود مخاطبة المسلمين الجدد و حثهم أن يكونوا كالسابقين.

"يا أيها الذين آمنوا لا تكونوا كالذين آذو موسى"

المقصود مخاطبة المسلمين الجدد لكى لا يكونوا كالمنافقين من بنى إسرائيل الذين آذو موسى.

Before Uhudd there was a disagreement about where they should take the fight and the young people who missed out on badr wanted to take the fight to the battlefield to show they are not afraid.

This was against the opinion of the prophet but he followed shurah and took the fight to the battlefield.

After Uhudd, Al-Imran was revealed and in it was verses talking to these young people.

وَلَقَدْ كُنتُمْ تَمَنَّوْنَ الْمَوْتَ مِن قَبْلِ أَن تَلْقَوْهُ فَقَدْ رَأَيْتُمُوهُ وَأَنتُمْ تَنظُرُونَ

This addressed the people that talked and told them that when the fighting came you froze "و أنتم تنظرون"

Indicating that talking is easy

"يا أيها الذين آمنوا لم تقولون ما لا تفعلون"

"كبر مقتا عند الله أن تقولوا ما لا تفعلون"

Not doing things is bad but saying things and not doing them is even worse.

مقت
It is when a father used to divorce his wives and his son would marry his step mothers.

It was a disgusting act for the arabs but it was done anyway.

This was called مقت.

---
"إن الله يحب الذين يقاتلون فى سبيله صفا كأنهم بنيان مرصوص"

Here allah added a condition, it is not enough that you fight, you have to fight صفا which indicates discipline.

It is not enough to have good intentions.

### الجمال فى قول "بنيان مرصوص"

Allah compares fighting believers to a wall that is cemented together with melted copper.

You can't become that wall instantly it has to take time to put the bricks, pour the lead, waiting for the molten lead ...etc

God is saying you are not in a position to fight until you as a community become like that wall.

Not all the bricks in the wall are connected together.

Everyone has a job and a role.

And muslims should unite in their local communities even if they are not connected with those who are far away **yet**
